### `Privacy Statement`
Saveddit is a web application built on top of react and makes use of serverless functions to authorize and fetch all the necessary data from the Reddit API. At no point of the process is your data being acquired (for any means other than to display it) or stored anywhere remote. Everything is stored locally (localStorage) on your browser, and managed with Redux. No external database, no tracking, no analytics. It is truly free to use and collects no data, see for yourself in the included source code.
